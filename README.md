Snake is a classical game from the 70â€™s. The simplicity of this addictive game resulted
in its availability on most of existing game platforms under a form or another. For "old"
people, Snake means hours and hours of slacking at school, using the mobile phone version
of the Nokia 3310. For youngsters, Snake is a 42 project referring to an obscure
game from prehistoric ages.
